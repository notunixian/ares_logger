# A.R.E.S Logger
[![HitCount](https://hits.dwyl.com/notunixian/ares_logger.svg?style=flat-square)](http://hits.dwyl.com/notunixian/ares_logger)

a "new" version of the [ares logger](https://github.com/Dean2k/ARESLogger) that was unfortunately (as well as all other melonloader mods) taken away as a result of EAC/EOS being implementented into VRChat.

## download latest version [here](https://github.com/notunixian/ares_logger/releases/latest)

### info
this project is intended to run with my [clr loader](https://github.com/notunixian/clr-loader), and a built version of the clr loader will be included in the releases.

this project also requires a working injecter, you can use my [fork of face injector](https://github.com/notunixian/face-injector-v2) which works on the latest windows version including developer branches. (a built version of this will also be included in the releases)
