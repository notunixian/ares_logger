# A.R.E.S Logger
a "new" version of the [ares logger](https://github.com/Dean2k/ARESLogger) that was unfortunately (as well as all other melonloader mods) taken away as a result of EAC/EOS being implementented into VRChat.

this project is intended to run with my [clr loader](https://github.com/notunixian/clr-loader), and a built version of the clr loader will be included in the releases.
